## Python Exercise 1: Printing out vowels and consonants

A python script `vowel_counter.py` is supposed to print out the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
Several users have reported problems, and one user has put in a pull request to improve the script. 

User reports:

```
Only vowels are getting printed out! This script is not working
```

```
This script is printing the number of consonants.
Why is `vowel_counter.py` even printing out the number of consonants?  
```

Take a look at the python script [python](python/exercise1/vowel_counter.py) 

* Can you see any errors?
* Do you need to run the script to test the behavior?


Take a look at the pull request.

* Does the pull request address the issue?

* What would improve the pull request? Could you use list comprehension? Would you except the solution as it is now?
