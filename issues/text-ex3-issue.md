## Text Exercise 3: Origami instructions

A person following along with an [origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami) tutorial suspects that the
instructions are incorrect.  Here is their feedback:

```
The origami fish instructions are missing at least one step.
I followed the instructions and did not get a fish.
```

Take a look at the instructions [origami.md](../text/exercise3/origami.md)

* Are there missing steps?
* Are the steps in the correct order?

Take a look at the pull request

* Does the pull request address the issue?
* Are there any unnecessary or incorrect changes?
* What would improve the pull request?
* Would you write the instructions differently for adults versus children?
