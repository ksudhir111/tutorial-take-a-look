## Description

First attempt at modularizing my league simulation code.
The goal is to have a module with the league simulation 
routines that I can use with several programs.

Looking for advice on anything I've missed!

I've updated the Makefile so you should be able to 
compile my new code.

I've added some comments to help explain the code.

## Fixes issue
